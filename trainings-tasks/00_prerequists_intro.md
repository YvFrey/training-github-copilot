# 🚀 GitHub Copilot Engineering Training: Flow & Autonomy

This training equips engineering peers to move beyond basic code completion and command GitHub Copilot's advanced features—mastering contextual guidance, agentic workflows, and autonomous delegation to accelerate code delivery and quality.

## 🎯 Module 00: Prerequisites and Developer Responsibility

### 📚 Training Goal and Context

This is an **interactive classroom training** session designed to move engineers beyond basic code completion and into **advanced, agentic workflows** to **accelerate speed** and **predictable code quality**.

The training is based on a **simple FastAPI application**, manageable by any engineer familiar with foundational programming concepts. We encourage everyone to **explore the capabilities and limitations of GitHub Copilot** in a high-trust, safe environment.

We encourage you to discuss actively with your colleagues during the session, and **manifest your new learned skills** by continuing to practice the concepts outside of the classroom.

### 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

Please ensure the following items are verified *before* the start of the hands-on session.

| Prerequisite | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. GitHub Copilot License** | Required | Ensure you have an active **Copilot Pro** or **Copilot Business/Enterprise** subscription linked to your GitHub account. |
| **2. Visual Studio Code** | Version **1.106.0**+ | Please ensure you have the **latest stable version** of VS Code installed to guarantee all agent and chat features are available. |
| **3. Required Extensions** | Installed | **GitHub Copilot Extension** and **GitHub Pull Requests Extension**. |
| **4. `uv` Utility** | Installed | The `uv` utility is required for fast environment and dependency management. |
| **5. Git Configuration** | Ready | Ensure your local `git` client is configured with your correct user name and email. |

## 🚀 Getting Started: Running the FastAPI App

Follow these steps to set up your environment and verify the application is running correctly.

### 1. Fully Set Up and Run Application
Execute these commands sequentially in your project root directory. This installs necessary tools, sets up dependencies, and starts the server.

```bash
pip install uv
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app
```

*Note: The app should be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.*

### 2. Verify Copilot & Swagger UI
Confirm the AI is active and the application is accessible.

* **Verify Copilot:** Open the Copilot Chat panel and ask a simple question like: `@copilot What is the main purpose of this repository?` A coherent, project-aware response confirms the extension is active and authenticated.
* **Verify Swagger:** Open your web browser and navigate to the Swagger documentation endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### 🗺️ Reflective Learning Structure

We encourage continuous learning. Between major steps, **take a moment to reflect** on the new techniques and consider how they can be immediately **applied to your current projects**.

* **Module I:** Context and Control (Learning to command the AI with precision)
* **Module II:** Dynamic Interaction (Mastering completions, Inline Chat, and Prompt Files)
* **Module III:** Version Control and Quality (Integrating Copilot into SCM review and commit flows)
* **Module IV:** Testing Framework (Establishing automated, policy-driven testing)
* **Module V:** Agentic Workflow and Customization (Delegating complex, iterative tasks to the autonomous Coding Agent)

### 🛡️ Developer Responsibility Mandate

The human developer remains the final authority.

> As an AI coding tool, Copilot provides suggestions based on learned patterns, but it does not guarantee correctness, optimality, or security. **The developer remains the final authority.** You are responsible for **rigorously reviewing, testing, and validating** all code generated by Copilot before deployment, ensuring compliance with all security standards. **Always be skeptical of generated code.**
