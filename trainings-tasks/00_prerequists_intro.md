# 🚀 AI Engineering Enablement Training: GitHub Copilot

#### This hands-on training helps engineers move beyond basic code completion by teaching practical use of GitHub Copilot for contextual guidance, agentic workflows, and safe automation to accelerate delivery and improve code quality.
---

## 🎯 Module 00: Prerequisites and Developer Responsibility

### 📚 Goal

The training is based on a **simple FastAPI application**, manageable by any engineer familiar with foundational programming concepts. We expect everyone to **explore the capabilities and limitations of GitHub Copilot**. You'll learn how to prompt effectively, use agentic features safely, and validate generated code.

We encourage you to discuss actively with your colleagues during the session, and **manifest your new learned skills** by continuing to practice the concepts outside of the classroom.

### 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

Please ensure the following items are verified *before* the start of the hands-on session.

-  **GitHub Copilot License**: Copilot Pro or Business/Enterprise tied to your GitHub account
- **Visual Studio Code**: Recommended: latest stable VS Code to ensure agent/chat features are available
- **Required Extensions**: Install: GitHub Copilot and GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extensions
- **`uv` Package Manager** : The `uv` utility is required for fast environment and dependency management
- **Git Configuration**: Ensure your local `git` client is configured with your correct user name and email

## 🚀 Getting Started: Running the FastAPI App

Run the following in the project root to install `uv`, sync the environment, and start the app locally. These commands assume you have a Python environment and `pip` available.

```bash
cd app
pip install --upgrade uv
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The app will normally be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Verify Copilot and API docs

- Verify Copilot: Open the Copilot Chat panel in VS Code and ask a project-aware question such as: "What is the main purpose of this repository?" A coherent response indicates Copilot is active and has access to the workspace.
- Verify Swagger UI: Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs in your browser to view the automatically generated API documentation.

## 🗺️ Learning path (modules)

- Module I — Context & Control: precise prompting and workspace context
- Module II — Dynamic Interaction: completions, Inline Chat, and prompt files
- Module III — Version Control & Quality: integrating Copilot into SCM and reviews
- Module IV — Testing Framework: automating tests and policy checks
- Module V — Agentic Workflows: delegating and supervising autonomous agents

## 🛡️ Developer Responsibility Mandate

As an AI coding tool, Copilot provides suggestions based on learned patterns, but it does not guarantee correctness, optimality, or security. **The developer remains the final authority.** You are responsible for **rigorously reviewing, testing, and validating** all code generated by Copilot before deployment, ensuring compliance with all security standards. **Always be skeptical of generated code.**
