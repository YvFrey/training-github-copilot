# 🚀 AI Engineering Enablement Training: GitHub Copilot

#### This hands-on training helps engineers move beyond basic code completion by teaching practical use of GitHub Copilot for contextual guidance, agentic workflows, and safe automation to accelerate delivery and improve code quality.
---

## 🎯 Module 00: Prerequisites and Developer Responsibility

### 📚 Goal

The training is based on a **simple FastAPI application**, manageable by any engineer familiar with foundational programming concepts. We expect everyone to **explore the capabilities and limitations of GitHub Copilot**. You'll learn how to prompt effectively, use agentic features safely, and validate generated code.

We encourage you to discuss actively with your colleagues during the session, and **manifest your new learned skills** by continuing to practice the concepts outside of the classroom.

### 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

To ensure a smooth session, please ensure the following items are verified *before* the start of the hands-on session:

-  **GitHub Copilot License**: Copilot Pro or Business/Enterprise tied to your GitHub account
   -  **Use the 30-day free trial** — [Sign up for the 30-day free trial for GitHub Copilot Pro](https://github.com/github-copilot/pro)
   -  **Already used the trial?** — Contact us so we can find a solution.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Recommended to use latest stable VS Code to ensure agent/chat features are available
- **Required Extensions**: Install the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [GitHub Pull Requests & Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extensions in VS Code
-  **`uv` Package Manager**: The `uv` utility is required for fast environment and dependency management: [uv Installation Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- **Git Configuration**: Ensure your local `git` client is configured with your correct user name and email
- **Code Base**: Fork the [course repository](https://github.com/YvFrey/training-github-copilot/tree/main) to your own GitHub account (use the "Fork" button on GitHub). Clone your project locally. This setup ensures you have all necessary permissions.

### ⚠️ Important: Feature Alignment and Version Check

Please note that Copilot features evolve **rapidly**, with changes and new features often released on a **weekly basis**. Please excuse if a specific task is not fully up to date or available in your version. This training was tested on the following stable environment. If you encounter errors, verify your version alignment or report the discrepancy to the trainer.

* **VS Code Version:** 1.106.3
* **GitHub Copilot Extension Version:** github.copilot@1.388.0, github.copilot-chat@0.33.3
* **Python Environment Manager (uv):** 0.8.10

## 🚀 Getting Started: Running the FastAPI App

Run the following in the project root to install `uv`, sync the environment, and start the app locally. These commands assume you have a Python environment and `pip` available.

```bash
cd app
pip install --upgrade uv
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The Swagger UI will now be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### Verify Copilot

- Verify Copilot: Open the Copilot Chat panel in VS Code and ask a project-aware question such as: "What is the main purpose of this repository?" A coherent response indicates Copilot is active and has access to the workspace.

## 🛡️ Developer Responsibility Mandate

As an AI coding tool, Copilot provides suggestions based on learned patterns, but it does not guarantee correctness, optimality, or security. **The developer remains the final authority.** You are responsible for **rigorously reviewing, testing, and validating** all code generated by Copilot before deployment, ensuring compliance with all security standards. **Always be skeptical of generated code.**
