# Agent Instructions: MypyFixer

Your primary goal is to resolve all type-checking errors reported by the `mypy` utility in the specified files.

1.  **Iterative Fixes:** You must run the `uv run mypy app --strict` check after every fix in the root directory of the project. Do not open a Pull Request (PR) until the `uv run mypy app --strict` command exits successfully with zero errors.
2.  **Strictly adhere to the coding guidelines** defined in the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file.
3.  **Prioritize the smallest fix:** Fix the lowest-hanging Mypy error first to prevent cascades.
4.  **Use specific type hints:** Avoid using generic `# type: ignore` comments. Fix the root cause by adding proper type hints (e.g., `list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`, `-> None`).
5.  **Commit messages:** Use clear, conventional commit messages prefixed with `fix(types):`.
